 Displacement Tracking Matrix - Analysis of IDP situation in Iraq
========================================================

Based on the data currently available the objective is to build an index that will help prioritising the area of intervention for the CCM cluster.

The possible calculations are:

 - % of IDP hosted in communal settings / private settings 
 - # of IDP hosted in communal setting  
 - are idps  hosted in school building? as this has a disruptive impact on local population
 - are idps are already in camp (compared to other communal setting)
 - do they access services? (in priority FOOD, WATER, NFI) 
 - what is the # of IDP in a district compared to # of refugees?
 - # of IDP in a district compared to # of local inhabitans
 - when IDP have been displaced ? (i.e. date of displacement -> pre-june /post-june).
 - has the location previously received assistance
 - has shelter been defined as one of the priority need?

We will score each of the composite indicator and then apply some ponderation in order to generate a vulnerability rank for the locations.
